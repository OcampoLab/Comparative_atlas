### Abstract
In vivo reprogramming through the forced expression of Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc (OSKM) has demonstrated great potential for reversing age-associated phenotypes, as the combination of these transcription factors actively promote cell regeneration and rejuvenation in various tissues and organs. However, continuous in vivo OSKM expression raised safety concerns due to loss of cell identity, decrease in body weight, and premature death. Although cyclic short-term or targeted expression of the reprogramming factors can mitigate some of these detrimental effects in mice, systemic rejuvenation of wild type mice has remained elusive potentially due to these current technical limitations. To improve the fundamental understanding of in vivo reprogramming, we conducted a comparative analysis across multiple reprogrammable mouse strains, tissues, and expression methods, presenting a comprehensive atlas of formerly established strains. In addition, we developed novel reprogrammable mouse strains by avoiding OSKM expression in specific organs, in dividing cells, or implementing chimeric expression approaches within specific cells, thereby offering safer strategies to induce in vivo reprogramming and fully harness its potential. We hope that these new tools will become valuable resources for future research in this very exciting field of research with potential implications to human health.
