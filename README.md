# Comparative analysis of in vivo reprogramming mouse strains

### Abstract

In vivo reprogramming through the forced expression of Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc (OSKM) has demonstrated promising potential for reversing age-related features, as these factors actively promote cell regeneration and rejuvenation in various organs and tissues. However, continuous in vivo OSKM expression raised safety concerns, including cell identity loss, weight decrease, teratoma formation and premature death. Pulsed or targeted expression mitigated these issues in mice, but systemic rejuvenation remained elusive. To address this, we conducted a comparative analysis of reprogramming across mouse strains, tissues, and expression methods, presenting a comprehensive atlas of several reprogrammable strains. In these strains, OSKM has been expressed throughout the body, selectively avoiding specific organs or adopting a chimeric approach within specific cells, thereby offering valuable data for the study of reprogramming. We highlight the need of safer in vivo reprogramming to fully harness its potential, providing valuable insights for future research in this field.
